# Social AI Assistant — Architecture & Contract

> **Purpose of this file.** Single source of truth for the project's structure, data model,
> API contract, and conventions. Paste it (or sync it) at the start of any session to orient
> quickly. When a contract changes, change it *here first*, then update the code to match.
> This file documents the **actual current state of the repo**, including known mismatches
> that still need reconciling — those are flagged with ⚠️.

## 1. What this is

A Flask + React app for managing customer conversations across social channels
(Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, TikTok) with AI-generated replies, a rules engine,
and a human-override inbox.

### Tech stack
- **Backend:** Flask (app-factory pattern), SQLAlchemy, Flask-Migrate, Flask-JWT-Extended, Flask-CORS, bcrypt
- **DB:** PostgreSQL (SQLite fallback for dev via `DATABASE_URL`)
- **Frontend:** React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, Vite, lucide-react, clsx
- **AI:** Anthropic Claude API (`config.CLAUDE_MODEL`)
- **Integrations:** Meta Graph API (IG/WA/FB), Shopify (products + stock), TikTok

## 3. Data model (authoritative: `app/models.py` + `database/schema.sql`)

### Two distinct "user" concepts — do not conflate
- **`auth_users`** (`AuthUser`): internal staff who log into the dashboard. Roles: `admin | agent | supervisor`. Status: `active | inactive | suspended`.
- **`users`** (`User`): external **customers** who message in. Identified by `(external_id, channel)` — the *same human* on IG and WhatsApp is **two rows**.

### Tables
| Table | Model | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `auth_users` | `AuthUser` | bcrypt `password_hash`; `to_dict()` exists |
| `audit_logs` | `AuditLog` | staff action trail; written by `log_audit()` in `auth.py` |
| `users` | `User` | customers; unique `(external_id, channel)` |
| `conversations` | `Conversation` | one thread = one customer on one channel |
| `messages` | `Message` | `direction` inbound/outbound; `sender` ai/human/system |
| `products_cache` | `ProductCache` | Shopify metadata; **never** store stock here |
| `stock_cache` | `StockCache` | short-TTL Shopify stock |
| `ai_settings` | `AISettings` | single active row (id=1) |
| `automation_rules` | `AutomationRule` | IF/THEN rules; `trigger_config`/`action_config` JSON |
| `logs` | `Log` | pipeline audit trail (separate from `audit_logs`) |

### Key conventions
- **Channel** values (used everywhere — DB column is `channel`):
  `instagram_dm | instagram_comment | whatsapp | facebook_dm | facebook_comment | tiktok_dm | tiktok_comment`
- **Conversation.status:** `active | resolved | human_override | pending`
- **AI enabled** is tracked at *two* levels: `User.ai_disabled` (per customer) and `Conversation.ai_enabled` (per thread). The inbox toggle operates on the **conversation**.

> ⚠️ **`AISettings` references OpenAI/`gpt-4o`** in column comments and the `model` default,
> but the project standardized on Claude (`config.CLAUDE_MODEL`). Reconcile the default and
> comments when the AI Settings page is built.

## 4. API contract

Base URL (frontend default): `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api` (`VITE_API_BASE` overrides).
All non-auth endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`.

### 4.1 Auth (`app/auth.py`, prefix `/api/auth`) — STABLE
| Method | Path | Body | Returns |
|--------|------|------|---------|
| POST | `/login` | `{email, password}` | `{token, user}` |
| POST | `/signup` | `{email, password, full_name, role}` (admin only) | `{user}` |
| GET | `/verify` | — | user dict |
| POST | `/logout` | — | `{message}` |
| GET | `/me` | — | user dict |
| GET | `/users` | — (admin) | `{users}` |
| GET | `/users/<id>` | — (admin) | user dict |
| PUT | `/users/<id>` | `{full_name?, role?, status?}` (admin) | `{user}` |
| DELETE | `/users/<id>` | — (admin) | `{message}` |
| GET | `/audit-logs` | `?user_id&action&limit&offset` (admin) | `{logs, total, limit, offset}` |

### 4.2 Inbox / Messages — ⚠️ **CONTRACT IN CONFLICT** (see §6)

This is the area that needs reconciling. The three layers currently disagree. The
**canonical contract below is the PROPOSED target** — code does not yet fully match it.

**Decisions (proposed canonical):**
- Pagination: **`page` / `per_page`** (offset-style, friendly convention). Response includes `total`, `page`, `per_page`.
- Channel filter param: **`channel`** (mirror the DB column; no `platform` on the wire).
- List response: `{ conversations: [...], total, page, per_page }`
- Single conversation: returned **wrapped** as `{ conversation: {...} }`.
- Send reply: `POST /conversations/<id>/messages` with `{ content, sender }`, returns the created message (+ updated conversation).

| Method | Path | Params / Body | Returns (canonical) |
|--------|------|---------------|---------------------|
| GET | `/conversations` | `?page&per_page&channel&status&search` | `{conversations, total, page, per_page}` |
| GET | `/conversations/<id>` | — | `{conversation: {..., messages: [...]}}` |
| GET | `/conversations/<id>/messages` | — | `{messages}` |
| POST | `/conversations/<id>/messages` | `{content, sender}` | `{message, conversation}` |
| PATCH | `/conversations/<id>` | `{status?}` | `{conversation}` |
| PATCH | `/conversations/<id>/ai` | `{ai_enabled}` | `{conversation}` |
| PATCH | `/conversations/<id>/read` | — | `{conversation}` |

### 4.3 Webhooks (`app/routes.py`, blueprint `main`) — STABLE
- `GET /` health check
- `GET /webhook/{instagram,whatsapp,facebook}` — Meta verification challenge (`hub.challenge`)
- `POST /webhook/instagram`, `/webhook/instagram/comments`, `/webhook/whatsapp`, `/webhook/facebook`, `/webhook/facebook/comments`
- All inbound POSTs funnel into `services.process_message(message, user_id, channel)`.

---

## 5. AI / message pipeline (`app/services.py`)

`process_message(message, user_id, channel)`:
1. `detect_intents(message)` → list (multi-intent), via `app/utils/intent.py`
2. Fetch context: Shopify product+stock for product/price/stock intents; flag delivery/order-status
3. `ai.generator.generate_reply(message, intents, context_data, channel)`
4. `_dispatch_reply(...)` → correct `integrations` sender (currently **mocked**, `meta.USE_MOCK=True`)
5. Persist inbound + outbound `Message` rows; intents stored pipe-joined (`a|b|c`) via `intents_to_label`

---

## 6. ⚠️ Known contract mismatch — Inbox (the thing to fix next)

As of the last sync, the three layers were written against different assumptions:

| Layer | Pagination | Channel param | Reply endpoint | Single-conv shape |
|-------|-----------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| `frontend/src/api/messages.js` (repo) | `page` / `per_page` | `channel` | `POST .../messages` `{content, sender}` | reads `data.conversation` |
| `frontend/src/pages/Messages.jsx` (repo) | calls `listConversations({platform, search})` | `platform` | — | `data.conversation` |
| `app/messages.py` (repo) | `limit` / `offset` | `platform` (filters `Conversation.channel`) | `POST .../reply` `{text}` | wraps `{conversation}` |

**Resolution plan:** adopt §4.2 canonical contract. Concretely:
- Backend `list_conversations`: switch `limit/offset` → `page/per_page`, rename `platform` → `channel`, return `page/per_page` in body.
- Backend reply: standardize on `POST /conversations/<id>/messages` `{content, sender}` (retire `/reply` `{text}` or keep as alias).
- `Messages.jsx`: call `listConversations({ page, per_page, channel, status })`; the component may keep an internal `platform` label but must send `channel`.
- `api/messages.js`: already close to canonical; align `toggleAI` to the dedicated `PATCH .../ai` endpoint rather than overloading status.

**Pagination note:** `page/per_page` is the chosen convention for now. The conversation list is
really an infinite-scroll feed ordered by `last_message_at`; at higher volume, migrate the list
endpoint (only) to keyset/cursor pagination for stable, index-seek performance. Contained change.

---

## 7. ⚠️ Duplicate intent systems

There are **two** intent detectors with different label vocabularies:
- `app/utils/intent.py` — `detect_intents()` (multi-intent). **This is the one `services.py` uses.**
  Labels include: `greeting, stock_inquiry, product_inquiry, price_inquiry, delivery_inquiry, order_status, complaint, unknown`.
- `app/router.py` — `detect_intent()` (single-intent, regex). Different labels (`price_query`, `stock_query`, `escalation`, `ai_fallback`) and contains a typo (`goo morning`). **Appears unused by the pipeline.**

`automation_rules` seed data references intents like `complaint` and `order_status` (the `utils/intent.py`
vocabulary). **Recommendation:** treat `utils/intent.py` as canonical; delete or refactor `router.py`
to avoid drift. Pick one label set and document it here.

---

## 8. Conventions & gotchas

- **JWT storage key (frontend):** `localStorage['authToken']` (per repo `api/messages.js`). Use this key everywhere.
- **Auth identity:** JWT `identity` is `AuthUser.id`; `get_jwt_identity()` returns it.
- **Two log tables:** `audit_logs` (staff actions, via `log_audit`) vs `logs` (pipeline events, via `log_event`). Don't mix.
- **Secrets:** everything comes from env (`config.py`). Ensure `.env` is gitignored and never committed — the GitHub sync reads file contents verbatim.
- **CORS:** currently `origins: "*"` for `/api/*`. Tighten before production.
- **Mock flags:** `integrations/meta.py` has `USE_MOCK = True`. Real sends raise `NotImplementedError` until credentials + `requests` calls are added.
- **Test users** (`database/auth_migration.sql`): `admin@company.com / admin123`, `agent@company.com / agent123`, `supervisor@company.com / supervisor123`. Dev only.

## 9. TODO (priority order)
1. **Messages/Inbox** — reconcile the §6 contract, then verify end-to-end. ← current focus
2. Channels page — connect/disconnect social accounts
3. Products page — Shopify sync + inventory display
4. AI Settings & Automation — rules engine backend
5. Analytics & Logs — surface `logs` / `audit_logs`
6. AI message generation — finish `ai/generator.py` Claude integration
7. Channel integrations — real Meta webhooks/sends, Shopify, TikTok (flip `USE_MOCK`)
8. Testing & deployment

---

## 10. How to keep this doc honest
- Change the **contract here first**, then the code. PRs that change an endpoint must update §4.
- When you resolve a ⚠️, delete the warning and move the fact into the stable section.
- Re-sync the GitHub connector before a session that depends on current code, and bump the date in the header.





also what exactly do i do with that postman collection file?

Conversation history → passed as previous messages in the Claude API call
Image URLs from Meta → passed as image content blocks (Claude handles vision)
Shared post metadata → enriched with a Shopify lookup if the post URL matches a product

Then (one focused milestone): "wire up real Claude" — and that milestone includes: history context, image support, shared-post extraction. It's all one coherent piece of work because it's all about giving the model what it needs.
Defer indefinitely: voice notes (rare, transcription cost, low value for fashion/beauty MVP), stickers/reactions (low signal).


The token will cache in memory for the lifetime of the Flask app. Since tokens expire after 24 hours, for production you'd want to:
Store the token expiry time
Refresh before it expires
Handle refresh gracefully if a token is rejected


Every customer message that mentions a product triggers a Shopify API call. At Shopify's 2 calls/sec rate limit, you'd start hitting throttling around 100+ messages/minute. Not a current problem; future problem.
The products_cache we just synced isn't being used by the AI pipeline — only the Products page reads it. The AI still goes direct to Shopify. Eventually it'd be smarter to have the AI read from products_cache (instant, no rate limit) and just keep the cache fresh on a schedule. That's a future optimization, not now.


⚠️ Latent issue from earlier: real Shopify's `_real_get_product_info` and `_real_list_all_products` return prices as `f"..."‘(dollar−prefixed).Your‘formatprice‘stripsnon−digitswhenparsingforthecache,sothecached‘price‘columnisnumericallyhonest,thendisplaysas‘"KESX,XXX"‘viatheformatter.Soend−to−endit∗appears∗correct—butifyourstoreisactuallyinKES,the‘{...}"` (dollar-prefixed). Your `_format_price` strips non-digits when parsing for the cache, so the cached `price` column is numerically honest, then displays as `"KES X,XXX"` via the formatter. So end-to-end it *appears* correct — but if your store is actually in KES, the `
..."‘(dollar−prefixed).Your‘f​ormatp​rice‘stripsnon−digitswhenparsingforthecache,sothecached‘price‘columnisnumericallyhonest,thendisplaysas‘"KESX,XXX"‘viatheformatter.Soend−to−endit∗appears∗correct—butifyourstoreisactuallyinKES,the‘` from Shopify is being silently dropped, and if it ever isn't KES, the display would be lying. Worth fixing for real later by either dropping the prefix in the Shopify functions or making `_format_price` currency-aware. Not blocking now.
⚠️ Same caveat: stock counts are summed correctly (issue #6 fix) but if read_inventory scope is missing, they'd all read 0. You haven't said either way — worth a glance at a product or two in GET /api/products to see if stock_quantity looks plausible.


One thing worth flagging: Test 7's response_rules behavior is "replace, don't merge" — sending {"use_emoji": false} will wipe the other rules and leave only that one. If you'd rather "merge" semantics (partial updates within response_rules), say so and it's a small change.

 one noteworthy thing: row id=1 already existed from your earlier seed (still has the old response_rules)


implement sweet alert for notifications!

So my honest revised recommendation:

Build Logs now with this role-aware shape, querying audit_logs (everyone) and logs (admin-only). Works perfectly today for agent personal-action logs and admin pipeline logs.
Build Analytics next — same role model, but the agent view will be a bit thin until assignment endpoints exist.
Then add assignment endpoints as a small milestone — finally giving the foundation columns we added weeks ago a way to be populated. After this, agent analytics gets richer (per-agent conversation counts, response times, etc.).


Delivery details — "We deliver across Kenya. Standard delivery to Nairobi is X days at KES Y. Up-country delivery takes X-Y days at KES Z."
Return policy — "Customers can return unworn items within X days of delivery."
Signature collections — if Shop Zetu has named collections ("The Office Capsule," "Statement Saturdays," etc.) name them so the AI can recommend across the catalog
Slogan or tagline — if Shop Zetu has one, include it so the assistant can echo it naturally
Payment methods — M-Pesa, cards, etc.
